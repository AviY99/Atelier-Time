# Atelier Time

A planned offline-capable, installable posing/break timer for live-model **drawing and sculpting** ateliers.

**Project status (2026-10-22):** Stage 0 complete. **Stage 1 Step 1.1 approved and complete. Step 1.2 data-model design prepared for review. Step 1.3 not authorized.** No app source code, Flutter scaffold, build or tests have started.

Atelier Time lets an organizer configure pose and break rules, generate and approve a chronological schedule, save reusable presets, and run a timer with three distinct sound cues. If the last pose would be incomplete, schedule review offers: (1) keep the remaining short final pose; (2) split the time of the last two poses as evenly as possible; or (3) adjust their split with a ruler/slider.

## Important project boundaries

- An existing GitHub repository is being used. No application implementation has started.
- **Approved:** One Flutter + Dart codebase for Android, Windows, iOS/iPadOS and macOS in the first release; platform-specific compiled packages. Native OS menus/graphics are optional.
- **Still open:** package distribution/signing strategy, long-break midpoint/edge policies, UI design and logo. Data model is documentation only; no code/scaffold or Step 1.3 until separate authorization.
- Every number in both timing examples is configurable through a future per-session input screen; pose groups can be added/removed.
- “Summary” is a named final reserved time block; its specific activity has not been further defined.
- Do not silently convert open technical assumptions into approved product rules.
- Every iteration must update the decision log, work log, change log and handoff with evidence and next actions.
