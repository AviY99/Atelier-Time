# Atelier Time

A planned offline-capable, installable posing/break timer for live-model **drawing and sculpting** ateliers.

**Project status (2026-10-22):** Stage 0 and Step 1.1 complete; Step 1.2 documented; Step 1.3 under review with **latest D-036: session total and configured breaks must be positive**, and retained D-031 **25-minute accumulated posing/5-minute adequate rest warning**. Step 1.4 implementation is **NOT authorized**. No app source code, Flutter scaffold, builds or executable tests exist.

Atelier Time lets an organizer configure pose and break rules, generate and approve a chronological schedule, save reusable presets, and run a timer with three distinct sound cues. If the last pose would be incomplete, schedule review offers: (1) keep the remaining short final pose; (2) split the time of the last two poses as evenly as possible; or (3) adjust their split with a ruler/slider.

## Important project boundaries

- An existing GitHub repository is being used. No application implementation has started.
- **Approved:** One Flutter + Dart codebase for Android, Windows, iOS/iPadOS and macOS in the first release; platform-specific compiled packages. Native OS menus/graphics are optional.
- **Latest approved D-036:** A full session or a configured normal/active special break of **0 minutes is invalid** (blocking error). Positive 1–4-minute breaks remain allowed; **D-031 warning and explicit user acknowledgment** apply to a mathematically legal schedule exceeding the 25-minute posing / 5-minute rest recommendation. Regular/special defaults remain editable positive 5m/15m. Logical 0-minute break-slot proposals were withdrawn.
- **Still open:** Step 1.3 proposals for automatic/multiple break positions, validation edge behavior and whether pose accumulation carries over between distinct saved sessions; packaging/signing, UI and logo remain later decisions. No code/scaffold or Step 1.4 until separate authorization.
- Every number in both timing examples is configurable through a future per-session input screen; pose groups can be added/removed.
- “Summary” is a named final reserved time block; its specific activity has not been further defined.
- Do not silently convert open technical assumptions into approved product rules.
- Every iteration must update the decision log, work log, change log and handoff with evidence and next actions.
